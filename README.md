Language models are open knowledge graphs ( work in progress )

A non official reimplementation of [Language models are open knowledge graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11967)

The implemtation of Match is in process.py

![example bob dylan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theblackcat102/language-models-are-knowledge-graphs-pytorch/main/images/bob_dylan.png)

### Execute MAMA(Match and Map) section

Do note the extracted results is still quite noisy and should then filtered based on relation unique pair frequency

```
python extract.py examples/bob_dylan.txt bert-large-cased-bob_dynlan.jsonl --language_model bert-large-cased --use_cuda false
```

## Map

1. Entity linking

The original download link for Stanford Entity linking is removed (nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/crosswikis-data.tar.bz2)[nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/crosswikis-data.tar.bz2]. I will use (REL)[https://github.com/informagi/REL] for entity disambiguation model (supervised instead of the original unsupervied) to achieve the same task.

2. Relations linking (page 5, 2.2.1)

Lemmatization is done in the previous steps [process.py](), in this stage we remove inflection, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, adverbs words.
